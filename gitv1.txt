.git directory stores
  everything as sha1s
  commit objects
  folder or directory objects
  file objects
windows directory 
  aka working directory where we load un-sha1ed files pointed to by the head
Example directory tree
.
  menu.txt
  recipes
    README.txt
    apple_pie.txt
git init creates 
  .git/ directory inside the working directory that contains
  head that points to 
  master branch that points to 
  initial commit that points to the 
  working directory containing the .git folder
  that contains all tree and blob sha1s of all the directory recurisively
  except for the .git/ directory
git status = gets status of files
Three different statuses
  unstaged
  staged
  committed
git add file.txt = adds file.txt to committing area
git add folder/ = adds folder and all it's contents to commiting area
git commit -m "First commit!" = commits files
git log = displays list of commits
sha1s representing the same content (ie a sha1 with the same number) 
  will never be recreated
  if the content produces the same sha1
  folders will point to the initial sha1.
  even if folders have the different names with same content.
If 2 files have the same content (ie. same sha1)
  2 folders are point to the same sha1
  if one of the files get's modified
  the modified file will get a new sha1
  the folder will point to a new sha1 with that independant file name
  other folder will point to old sha1
head is text referencing a branch (ie. ref: refs/head/master) it is not a sha1
  master is a branch pointer (reference) containing a sha1 of a commit
  initial commit is a sha1 that contains the metadata and the following
    tree sha1 of the contents of ./ directory , as
      blob sha1 of content of menu.txt 
      tree sha1 of contents of recipes directory which contains list of recipes directory as
        blob sha1 of content of README.txt
        blob sha1 of content of apple_pie.txt
names of trees and blobs are not in the objects themselves
  the are stored in the containing tree
  the same blob with different names can be pointed at by different trees
  the name of the blob may be different in each tree
  the content is the same
    
*** Change content of file.txt ***
git status 
add add file.txt
git cat-file -p sha11kdhajdfllakjdf to print out content of sha1
git object model
  blob
  tree
  commit
  annotated tag
git count-objects

*** Branches ***
git init creates the 
  the head that points to the 
  first branch, "Master" Branch that points to the 
  first commit that points to the working directory
  that contains the sha1 of all objects in directory except for
  .git/ directory
git branch
  displays the branches in git
  First branch is the master branch
  An asterick is placed next to current branch
All commits contain 
  sha1 of working directory
  which contain all recursive
  sha1 objects
A branch
  is a pointer reference to a commit
  many branches can point to the same commit
Master branch 
  not anything special
  just like any branch
  we can rename it or even delete it.
git branch lisa
  new branch named lisa
  creates a new branch (reference to a commit) 
  references the same commit as current branch
Head
  is a reference to a branch (Such as Master) that references a commit
  there can be only one head, but many branches
  is what determines the current branch
  Whatever the head is pointing at is the current branch
  head is not a sha1
cat ./git/HEAD prints out
  ref: refs/heads/master(or other branch)
When there is more than 1 branch, you change a file, and you call git commit
  A commit is exicuted creating a new commit object
  Git looks inside the head file to find the current branch
  The current branch moves to point to the new commit object
  Head pointer does not move but still points to current branch pointer

*** Checkout ***
When you commit a checkout
  split forms following lisa's path and not the other branch
git checkout lisa
  lisa becomes the current branch
  git points the head pointer to point to lisa
  git replaces files and folders in working area (directory) with those of lisa stored in .git folder
now let's modify files in lisa working space
git commit -m "Add Lisa's version of the pie"
  git adds the commit to the object database
  git looks in head pointer to find the current branch pointer (lisa branch)
  git then has the current branch pointer (lisa branch) point to the new commit
  a split is created.

*** Merge Lisa's branch to Master Branch ***
git checkout master
  head must point to file you want to merge into
git merge lisa
  merge operation started
if changes are in the same file
  merge process is still pending, not finished or discarded
  a conflict has occured
  we must fix then save conflicts
open file with webstorm or another editor
  fix changes and save changes manually
git status
  to see if we are out of conflict
  to see if it is not staged to commit
git add recipes/apple_pie.txt
  git adds to staging area
git commit 
  After conflicts have been resolved, added to staging area, we can commit to finish the merge process
  because it's a merge it adds a message automatically
  we can override with a -m 'message of my own'
  a new commit has been created
  git looks inside head pointer to find current branch 
  changes current branch to point to new commit
  lisa pointer does not change
git log
  to get sha1 of most current commit
git cat-file -p sha1
  the new commit has 2 or more parents instead of 1
  parent 1 from master
  parent 2 from lisa
  parent ....
Objects in database are
  immutable 
  persistent
Files in working directory 
A merge is a commit
  just with 2 or more parents
Commits only
  if new file
    new sha1 is created
    points to new sha1
  non-modified files
    remains pointing to unmodified sha1
*** References ***
References
  init master commit doesn't reference another commit
  secondary commits reference 1 or 2 parent commits
  all commits can references trees
  all commits can references blobs  
  all trees can reference trees
  all trees canreference blobs
References between commits 
  are used to track history
References between all other objects
  are used to track content
  content
*** Fast Forward - Merge Lisa with Master ***
After merge
git checkout lisa
git merge master
  git has lisa's pointer sha1 point to same sha1 as master
*** Detatched Head ***
git checkout master
  head points to a branch
git checkout sha1
  head points directly to a commit
  head does not contain a (ref: refs/heads/master(or other branch))
  head now contains the sha1 of the new commit
Make changes and commit
  new commit is created
  head sha1 reference is changed to the new commit
  master branch still contains previous commit sha1
  master branch does not change
Make changes and a second commit
If you don't like the changes
  you can checkout previous branch
git checkout master
  head now contains the sha1 of master branch
  previous commits above master branch will be garbage collected
  isolated commits can only be accessed by their sha1 (must write down)
  before they are garbage collected
  they will not be listed in git log

*** 3 Rules ***
1. Current branch, (pointed to by head) tracks new commits
2. When you move to another commit with checkout
   git updates your working directory with checkouted files
3. Unreachable objects are garbage collected

*** Rebase ***
Rebase
  creates new commit chain on top of second commit chain from the first commit chain
  the new commit chain has the same sha1s for the content
  but differ in the parent sha1s
  old commits are orphined
  old commits are garbage colleted
git checkout spaghetti
  head now contains sha1 of spaghetti branch
  spaghetti branch contains sha1 of commits with spaghetti recipe
git rebase master
  spaghetti branch is not disconnected from its base
  new spaghetti branch commits are created on top of master branch
  with different parents and same content
  master branch is now new base.
  original spaghetti commit chain is no longer referenced
  original spaghetti commit chain is garbage collected
  spaghetti branch is "rebased" on top of master as its new base
git checkout master
  head now contains master branch sha1
git rebase spaghetti = git merge spaghetti = fast forward
  master branch is updated
  it now contains spaghetti commit sha1
tags 
  branches that don't move

*** Git Distributed Version Control ***
git clone githubhttpsuri
git clone https://github.com/nusco/cookbook.git creates 
  cookbook folder containing 
  all file and recursive folder blobs in the "current" commit only and creates 
  .git/ directory inside cookbook folder which contain the 
  head containing a reference to the "master" branch that points to the 
  current commit that contains the sha1 of the
  working directory cookbook folder containing any
  recursive sha1s of folders and blobs
contents of working directory, in this case cookbook
  are not important
  did not need to be cloned
  can recreate them from .git/ directory
ls .git/
  displays content of ./git directory
ls .git/objects/
  displays the contents of owr working directory
  in sha1 format
github contains history of all commits while
  cloned version on my pc only contains 
  current commit containing the 
  sha1 of the master branch containing 
  sha1 of the working directory cookbook containing
  sha1 recursively down
vim .git/config file contains config information about project
  my .git/config file is different from instructors config file
  but he must have changed it in order to protect his git config file.

vim recipes/apple_pie.txt
  make changes
git add recipes/
git status

git commit -m "Add lemon juice to the apple pie"
***
New local commit
  generates a new "local" commit pointing to the 
  working directory in current state with
  head still pointing to the 
  same master branch now containing shaw of the
  new local commit
Remote master branch
  remains pointing to the original commit
  on its remote computer
  
git log -2 shows the 
  sha1 from the new commit
  sha1 of the previous commit
git show-ref master shows
  the sha1 of the remote current commit as that of the 
  old sha1 of the local log

*** git push (if no changes on remote commit) ***
  copies new sha1 of the new commit github
  remote head still points to the same master pointer
  changes the sha1 in the remote master to the 
  sha1 of the new commit
  both local and remote sha1s are now the same once again
  origin/master on local now contains same sha1 as master
  

Synchronizing with a remote
git fetch
  fetches new commit from origin
  origin/master old commit sha1 is replaced with
  new sha1 from newly fetched commit
git merge creates a 
  new commit
  replaces sha1 in master with new commit with newly created commit
git push pushes 
  newly created commit to origin and 
  old local master commit up to origin
  master in origin has it's sha1 updated to point to new commit on origin machine
  origin/master has it's sha1 updated to point to new commit on local machine

git pull is the same 
  git fetch then 
  git merge

So to synchronize with remote when we have modified local do the following
git pull
git push

*** Forks ***
go to github page such as https://github.com/Hendrixer/node-source-map-support
click fork 
  this copies a fork to your github page
you can now clone onto your local machine
